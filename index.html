                                    <h2 id="how-do-we-get-there">How do we get there?</h2>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://www.chianti-farm.com/download/Directions_Montevarchi.pdf">here</a> for directions and transportation options to Montevarchi, the nearest town to the villa</li>
<li>See <a href="https://www.chianti-farm.com/W_laselva_directions.pdf">here</a> for driving directions to the villa - we recommend you print these out if you’re driving!</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="should-we-rent-a-car">Should we rent a car?</h2>
<p>There are transportation options (e.g., trains) to Montevarchi, the nearest town, but you may want to rent a car to fully explore the area. There are only a few taxis (4!) in the area. There are some car rentals nearer to the venue, but we recommend you rent the car from the airports in Florence or Rome, to ensure there’s availability. If you’ll be driving, be sure to get a valid <a href="https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html">International Driving Permit (IDP)</a> which is mandatory for you to be able to rent a car in Italy.</p>
<h2 id="driving-in-italy">Driving in Italy</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x3s7ugy4a8emqg0/eng_laselva_driving_directions.pdf?dl=0">here</a> for driving directions to the villa - we recommend you print these out if you’re driving since they&rsquo;re a bit different from what your navigation might provide and in case you can&rsquo;t access them online. In general, we recommend you download maps in Google Maps so you can follow driving directions offline. A lot of the towns have narrow roads, so a smaller car will be the easiest to navigate with. Many major cities, like Florence, may be hard to drive in since they have a lot of one-way roads and entire pedestrian-only areas closed off to driving, so consider taking the train to explore those places.</p>
<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
<p>There a lots of different options for accomodations in the area. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/972627988">Here</a> are a few Airbnbs near the venue. If you prefer a hotel, there is the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488301-d657238-Reviews-Hotel_Valdarno-Montevarchi_Province_of_Arezzo_Tuscany.html">Hotel Valdarno</a> or <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/palazzo-mari-suite-amp-rooms-b-amp-b.it.html">Palazzo Mari</a> in Montevarchi.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-tofrom-the-wedding">Transportation to/from the wedding</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to take a taxi to the venue for the wedding, you will need to book your return taxi in advance since there are only 4 taxis available and the taxis typically don’t drive at night. Phone numbers for the taxi drivers are below. Since they speak little English, we recommend sending a message on Whatsapp using basic English to reserve with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>NINO:        +39    335398127</li>
<li>LUCA:        +39    331    7340000</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="coronavirus">Coronavirus</h2>
<p>Since all of the festivities will be outside and all of the guests who are able to get vaccinated will be, many of us won’t be wearing masks, but please do however you feel comfortable!

<h2 id="what-about-our-kiddos">What about our kiddos?</h2>
<p>We love our little friends and everyone is welcome at our wedding. If you haven’t already, let us know who all is coming so we can be sure to account for everyone. If there’s interest, we can also arrange a babysitter to join us at La Selva - let us know if you would want the night off and you’d be interested in that!</p>
<h2 id="hows-the-weather">How’s the weather?</h2>
<p>Tuscany weather is fairly mild most of the year. At the end of October is just when the weather starts getting a little chilly. Historical average of October says that it can get up to 19 Celsius (66 Fahrenheit) and down to 8 Celsius (46 Fahrenheit). We’ll be celebrating outside into the night, so we recommend folks bring a sweater or jacket for when the sun goes down.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-program-and-music-be-like">What will the program and music be like?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ll be having a relaxed dinner and might skip some of the typical wedding formalities, but we would love for any of our family and friends to make a toast, give a blessing, or say a little something during dinner. Let us know if you’re thinking of saying a few words so we can help the kitchen plan their service</li>
<li>We love good music and we know you do too. For dinner and dancing after the live music ends, add your favorite tracks to these playlists: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01BFFUNpaBdZXIdgStuZAY?si=7a9dc0fef6f14cb9">dinner</a> (mellow) or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4qPbgXfWLVhQZLr7TZ0SEd?si=90cd1969f2794265">party</a> (dancedancedance)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-day-after">The day after</h2>
<p>On Sunday October 31st at noon, join us at the villa for a casual pizza party! We&rsquo;ll be serving up typical Italian pizzas cooked on the spot in a wood pizza oven by the pool. You can choose whatever your heart desires: Margherita, Napoli, Quattro formaggi, Tartufi, Speck and gorgonzola, among others, you get the idea.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-have-food-allergies">What if I have food allergies?</h2>
<p>We are so excited to eat amazing, fresh Italian food with you all weekend! As much as possible, we encourage you to be flexible with your preferences and try the local food while you’re there (you won’t be disappointed!). If you do have an allergy, let us know ASAP so we can be sure to accommodate you.</p>
<h2 id="gifts">Gifts?</h2>
<p>We know it’s not easy to travel across the world to celebrate our wedding, especially this year, so your presence is plenty.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll get to experience Tuscany (and Italy) while you’re here - whether together with us or on your own. In the region, we’ve enjoyed exploring small towns, visiting markets and castles, and of course eating our way across the countryside.</p>

Tuscany is the region with the largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Properties in the world.
