      <description>How do we get there?  See here for directions and transportation options to Montevarchi, the nearest town to the villa See here for driving directions to the villa - we recommend you print these out if you’re driving! See here for a video of the drive from A1 VALDARNO Exit  Should we rent a car? There are transportation options (e.g., trains) to Montevarchi, the nearest town, but you may want to rent a car to fully explore the area.</description>

      <description>Exploring Tuscany We hope you’ll get to experience Tuscany (and Italy) while you’re here - whether together with us or on your own. In the region, we’ve enjoyed exploring small towns, visiting markets and castles, and of course eating our way across the countryside.
There are lots of places to visit nearby; including 7 UNESCO World Heritage Sites within 60 to 90 minutes by car or train. Tuscany is the region with the largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Properties in the world.</description>
